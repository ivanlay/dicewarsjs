# Dicewars JS

This is a modern, enhanced version of [Dice Wars](https://www.gamedesign.jp/games/dicewars/), a strategic dice-based territory conquest game. The project builds upon:

👉 [**Play the game online**](https://ivanlay.github.io/dicewarsjs/) 👈

1. The original game from [gamedesign.jp](https://www.gamedesign.jp/games/dicewars/)
2. [Chris Raff's modification](https://github.com/chrisraff/dicewarsjs) that added custom AI capabilities

This fork significantly extends the project with:

- Modern JavaScript practices (ES6+ modules, webpack)
- Improved architecture and code organization
- Enhanced gameplay features and UI improvements
- Comprehensive documentation for players and developers
- Developer tooling and quality assurance

The project is currently undergoing a significant modernization effort, migrating to ES6+ modules and practices. See our [ES6 Migration Plan](docs/ES6_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) and [Project Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for more details.

## Features

- Multiple AI players with different strategies
- Spectator mode to watch AI players compete
- Configurable game speed in spectator mode
- Mobile-friendly with touch support
- Responsive design that scales to fit your screen
- Battle history replay

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the modern development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. To test the legacy build run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:legacy
   ```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build

Modern build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Legacy build:

```bash
npm run build:legacy
```

Build both at once:

```bash
npm run build:all
```

The optimized files will be available in the `dist` directory and can be deployed to any web server.

### Bundle Analysis

Generate a bundle report to inspect the contents of the production build:

```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

Open `dist/bundle-report.html` to view the visualization. To enforce bundle size limits, run:

```bash
npm run perf:check
```

### Game Modes

- **Player vs AI**: Test your strategy against various AI opponents (default)
- **AI vs AI**: Watch AI players compete against each other in spectator mode
- **Battle Speed**: Adjust game speed in spectator mode for faster analysis

You can select "AI vs AI" on the title screen to enter spectator mode.

## Make Your Own AI

This project makes it easy to develop and test custom AI strategies.

### Modern Method (Recommended)

1. Create a new file in the `src/ai` directory:

   ```javascript
   // src/ai/ai_YourName.js
   export function ai_YourName(game) {
     // Your AI implementation here
     return 0; // Return 0 when done with turn
   }
   ```

2. Register your AI in `src/ai/index.js`:

   ```javascript
   export { ai_YourName } from './ai_YourName.js';
   ```

3. Add your AI to the registry in `src/Game.js`:
   ```javascript
   this.aiRegistry = {
     // Existing AIs...
     ai_YourName: ai_YourName,
   };
   ```

### AI Implementation Guide

Your AI function receives the game state and needs to make decisions about which territories to attack:

```javascript
function ai_YourName(game) {
  // Example: Find a territory you own with dice > 1
  const myTerritories = game.adat.filter(area => area.arm === game.get_pn() && area.dice > 1);

  if (myTerritories.length === 0) return 0; // End turn if no valid moves

  // For each territory, check neighbors for potential attacks
  for (const myArea of myTerritories) {
    const areaId = game.adat.indexOf(myArea);

    // Find enemy neighbors
    for (let j = 0; j < game.adat.length; j++) {
      if (myArea.join[j] && game.adat[j].arm !== game.get_pn()) {
        // Evaluate if attack is favorable
        if (myArea.dice > game.adat[j].dice) {
          // Attack! Set source and target areas
          game.area_from = areaId;
          game.area_to = j;
          return; // Don't return a value to execute the attack
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return 0; // End turn when no good moves are found
}
```

### Game State Reference

- `game.adat`: Array of all territories
- `game.adat[i].arm`: Player ID who owns territory `i`
- `game.adat[i].dice`: Number of dice in territory `i`
- `game.adat[i].join[j]`: Returns 1 if territories `i` and `j` are adjacent, 0 otherwise
- `game.get_pn()`: Current player's ID
- `game.area_from`: Set to the ID of attacking territory
- `game.area_to`: Set to the ID of defending territory

### Testing Your AI

You can test your AI by:

1. Changing the player assignments in `Game.js`
2. Using spectator mode to watch your AI compete against others
3. Analyzing performance statistics (if enabled)

## Configuration

Game settings can be configured through the settings UI or by editing configuration files:

```javascript
// Example configuration in src/config.js
export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  playerCount: 8, // Number of players (2-8)
  humanPlayerIndex: 0, // Set to null for AI vs AI mode
  spectatorSpeedMultiplier: 3, // Game speed in spectator mode
  soundEnabled: true, // Enable/disable game sounds
  battleHistoryLength: 10, // Number of battles to keep in history
  showProbabilities: true, // Show attack success probability
  territoriesCount: 40, // Number of territories
  maxDice: 8, // Maximum dice per territory
};
```

## Project Architecture

This project is transitioning to a modern architecture. The `src/` directory contains all modern ES6+ code and represents the future direction of the codebase. Legacy scripts located in the root directory (e.g., `game.js`, `main.js`, `areadice.js`, `mc.js`) are being progressively migrated into the `src/` structure or replaced by ES6 modules.

### Bridge Architecture

The project currently uses a bridge pattern to transition from legacy JavaScript to modern ES6 modules. This allows new code to be written using modern practices while maintaining compatibility with older parts of the system.

1.  **Modern Code**: New features and refactored components are developed as ES6 modules within the `src/` directory.
2.  **Legacy Compatibility**: Specific bridge modules (primarily under `src/bridge/`) expose functionalities from the modern ES6 modules to the global scope, making them accessible to legacy scripts that expect global variables and functions.
3.  **Incremental Migration**: This setup allows for a gradual modernization process. Components are migrated one by one, minimizing disruption and ensuring the game remains functional throughout the transition.

For more details, see [BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md). This bridge is a temporary measure to facilitate the migration. Our goal is to eventually have a fully ES6-module-based codebase or use adapters for any truly unmigratable legacy parts, as detailed in the ES6 Migration Plan.

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before committing any changes, ensure all quality checks pass:

1. **Run Tests**: All tests must pass

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   Expected result: All tests pass with no failures

2. **Format Code**: Ensure code formatting is consistent

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

   This will automatically format your code using Prettier

3. **Check Linting**: No linting errors should be present

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   Expected result: No errors (warnings are acceptable but should be minimized)

   To automatically fix linting issues:

   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   ```

4. **Verify Build**: Ensure the project builds successfully
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Expected result: Build completes without errors

If any of these checks fail, fix the issues before committing your changes. This ensures code quality and prevents breaking the build for other developers.

### Code Quality Tools

- **ESLint**: Enforces coding standards
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting
- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Webpack**: Bundles and optimizes code

Pre-commit hooks automatically format and lint changed files.

## Module Federation

DiceWarsJS can participate in a module federation setup. It can expose its AI
modules as a **remote** or consume them as a **host**.

### Run as a remote

Start the development server with the `role` set to `remote` and optionally
specify a port (defaults to `3000`):

```bash
npm run dev -- --env role=remote --env port=3001
```

This generates `remoteEntry.js` and exposes modules like `./AI` and `./Game`.

### Run as a host

To consume modules from another running instance, set the `role` to `host` and
provide the remote URL:

```bash
npm run dev -- --env role=host --env remoteUrl=http://localhost:3001
```

The host application will load the exposed modules from the remote instance at
the given URL.
