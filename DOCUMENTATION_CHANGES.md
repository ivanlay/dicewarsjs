The documentation for DiceWarsJS has been consolidated to improve organization and make it easier for developers to find information. Here's a summary of the changes:

## New Documentation Structure

```

    ├── ROADMAP.md (consolidated from NEXT_STEPS.md and docs/roadmap.md)
    ├── BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md (kept as-is)
    ├── CODE_STYLE.md (kept as-is)
    ├── CI_CD.md (kept as-is)
    ├── TESTING.md (kept as-is)
    ├── CLAUDE_GUIDE.md (simplified from CLAUDE.md)
    ├── fixes/
    │   └── WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_FIX.md (merged from PR-CHANGES.md and WEBPACK_FIX.md)
    ├── ai/
    │   └── DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (kept as-is)
    └── ai-strategies/ (kept as-is)
```

## Changes Made

1. **Created New Documentation Files**:

   - Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` that consolidates the project roadmap from NEXT_STEPS.md and docs/roadmap.md
   - Created `docs/fixes/WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_FIX.md` that merges the content from PR-CHANGES.md and WEBPACK_FIX.md
   - Created `docs/CLAUDE_GUIDE.md` as a simplified version of CLAUDE.md with just the essential information for Claude

2. **Updated README.md**:

   - Updated links to point to the new documentation structure
   - Added a Documentation section with links to all key documentation files
   - Fixed references to removed files

3. **Cleanup Script**:
   - Created cleanup-docs.sh that lists the files that can be removed and provides git commands to do so

## Files Ready for Removal

These files have been consolidated and can be removed:

- NEXT_STEPS.md (moved to docs/ROADMAP.md)
- PR-CHANGES.md (moved to docs/fixes/WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_FIX.md)
- WEBPACK_FIX.md (moved to docs/fixes/WEBPACK_DEVELOPMENT_FIX.md)
- CLAUDE.md (moved to docs/CLAUDE_GUIDE.md)
- docs/roadmap.md (merged into docs/ROADMAP.md)
- docs/roadmap_checklist.md (integrated into docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Documentation is now organized by topic and purpose
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Duplicate information has been consolidated
3. **Improved Findability**: Clear structure makes it easier to find specific information
4. **Centralized Roadmap**: All development planning is now in one place
5. **Simplified AI Setup**: AI development guide is more accessible

## Next Steps

1. Run the cleanup script to remove redundant files
2. Consider creating a dedicated ARCHITECTURE.md file that provides a high-level overview of the entire system
3. Add diagrams to visualize the architecture and data flow
