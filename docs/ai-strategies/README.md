## Game Mechanics Overview

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand the core game mechanics:

- **Territories and Ownership**: The map is divided into territories, each owned by a player and containing 1-8 dice.
- **Adjacency**: Territories can only attack adjacent territories.
- **Attack Mechanics**: When attacking, all dice from both territories are rolled. The higher total wins, with ties going to the defender.
- **Reinforcements**: Players receive reinforcement dice at the end of their turn based on their largest connected territory group.
- **Goal**: Eliminate all opponents by capturing all their territories.

## Basic Strategies

The most fundamental tactics for any DiceWars AI:

- [Dice Advantage Analysis](./basic/dice-advantage.md) - Attacking only when you have more dice than your opponent
- [Random Selection](./basic/random-selection.md) - Choosing randomly from valid moves
- [Player Ranking](./basic/player-ranking.md) - Identifying dominant players and focusing efforts
- [Territory Connections](./basic/territory-connections.md) - Managing connected territory groups for reinforcements

## Advanced Strategies

More sophisticated approaches to improve AI performance:

- [Neighbor Analysis](./advanced/neighbor-analysis.md) - Evaluating the risk of counterattacks
- [Border Security](./advanced/border-security.md) - Protecting vulnerable territories
- [Choke Point Control](./advanced/choke-point-control.md) - Identifying and controlling strategically valuable territories
- [Reinforcement Optimization](./advanced/reinforcement-optimization.md) - Maximizing the value of reinforcement dice

## Strategy Combinations

Examples of how to combine various strategies:

- [Balanced Approach](./combinations/balanced-approach.md) - Mixing offensive and defensive tactics
