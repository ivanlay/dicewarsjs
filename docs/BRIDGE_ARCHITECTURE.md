# Bridge Architecture: ES6 to Legacy Code

This document explains the bridge architecture used in DiceWarsJS to manage the transition from legacy code to modern ES6 modules.

## Overview

The bridge pattern implemented in this project allows us to:

1. Incrementally migrate to ES6 modules
2. Maintain backward compatibility with the legacy code
3. Avoid a complete rewrite while modernizing the codebase
4. Test and verify changes in isolation

## How the Bridge Works

The bridge consists of ES6 modules that:

1. Import functionality from modern ES6 module implementations
2. Export that functionality to the global window object for legacy code
3. Also provide proper ES6 exports for new code

```javascript
// Example: ai.js bridge
import {
  ai_default,
  ai_defensive,
  ai_example,
  ai_adaptive,
  AI_STRATEGIES,
  getAIById,
  getAllAIStrategies,
  createAIFunctionMapping,
} from '../ai/index.js';

// Export to global scope for legacy code
window.ai_default = ai_default;
window.ai_defensive = ai_defensive;
window.ai_example = ai_example;
window.ai_adaptive = ai_adaptive;

// Also export configuration to global scope
window.AI_STRATEGIES = AI_STRATEGIES;
window.getAIById = getAIById;
window.getAllAIStrategies = getAllAIStrategies;
window.createAIFunctionMapping = createAIFunctionMapping;

// Also export as ES6 module for new code
export {
  ai_default,
  ai_defensive,
  ai_example,
  ai_adaptive,
  AI_STRATEGIES,
  getAIById,
  getAllAIStrategies,
  createAIFunctionMapping,
};
```

## Bridge Components

The bridge system is composed of several modules:

1. **AI Bridge** (`src/bridge/ai.js`)

   - Exposes AI strategy functions to the global scope
   - Provides access to the centralized AI configuration system
   - Exposes helper functions for AI lookups and player-to-AI mapping
   - Used by the legacy game.js for AI player moves

2. **Game Utils Bridge** (`src/bridge/gameUtils.js`)

   - Provides utility functions used throughout the game
   - Contains helper functions for dice rolling, territory management, etc.

3. **Render Bridge** (`src/bridge/render.js`)

   - Exposes rendering functions to the global scope
   - Handles drawing game elements

4. **Sound Bridge** (`src/bridge/sound.js`)
   - Provides sound handling functionality
   - Manages game audio effects

## Initialization Timing Issues

One key challenge with the bridge architecture is initialization timing. Since webpack bundles the modules together, the execution order might differ from the traditional script loading.

### Problem

Legacy code might try to access bridged functions before they're initialized, causing errors like:

```
Uncaught runtime errors:
ERROR
ai_function is not a function
```

### Solutions

We've implemented several strategies to handle initialization timing:

1. **Delayed Initialization**

   - Initialize key objects with null/empty values initially
   - Populate with actual functions after modules are loaded
   - Example: Game.js now initializes AI array with nulls and populates it later in start_game()

2. **Function Existence Checks**

   - Add existence checks before calling potentially uninitialized functions
   - Provide fallbacks for missing functions
   - Example: com_thinking() now checks if ai_function exists before calling it

3. **Explicit Loading Order**
   - Ensure bridge modules are loaded before they are needed
   - Webpack entry points and import structure control this

## Best Practices for Bridge Components

When working with or adding to the bridge architecture:

1. **Always Check for Existence**

   ```javascript
   if (typeof window.myFunction === 'function') {
     // Safe to call
     window.myFunction();
   }
   ```

2. **Provide Fallbacks**

   ```javascript
   const myFunction =
     typeof window.myFunction === 'function' ? window.myFunction : defaultImplementation;
   ```

3. **Log Bridge Initialization**

   ```javascript
   // At the end of bridge modules
   console.log('Bridge module X successfully initialized');
   ```

4. **Test for Race Conditions**
   - Create tests that verify bridge functions are available when needed
   - Test different initialization scenarios

## Comprehensive Migration Plan

We are now implementing a structured 9-phase plan to complete the ES6 migration. For the full details, refer to the [Project Roadmap](./roadmap.md). The approach involves:

1. **Assessment and Planning**: Auditing the codebase and establishing migration priorities
2. **Infrastructure Setup**: Creating robust testing and build systems
3. **Core Component Migration**: Converting key game systems to ES6 modules
4. **UI and Interaction Migration**: Modernizing the rendering and input systems
5. **Optimization**: Implementing performance improvements and error handling
6. **Bridge Reduction**: Gradually removing bridge dependencies
7. **Unmigratable Code Strategy**: Creating adapters for legacy code that cannot be migrated
8. **Documentation and Cleanup**: Ensuring thorough documentation and code quality
9. **Final Bridge Removal**: Complete elimination of bridge components

This phased approach ensures that at each step the game remains functional while progressively reducing dependency on the bridge pattern.

## Bridge Component Removal Strategy

As we migrate modules to pure ES6, we'll follow this bridge removal process:

1. **Identify Direct Module Users**: Determine which legacy components use each bridge module
2. **Convert Legacy Dependents**: Migrate those legacy components to ES6 modules
3. **Replace Bridge Imports**: Update import statements to reference ES6 modules directly
4. **Remove Global Exports**: Once no legacy code depends on global exports, remove them
5. **Test Extensively**: Verify that no regressions are introduced at each step
6. **Final Removal**: Once all dependencies are migrated, remove the bridge module

Each bridge component will go through this process individually, allowing for incremental progress while maintaining a working application.

## Future Direction

The bridge architecture is a temporary solution to ease the transition to full ES6 modules. Eventually, all code will be migrated to ES6 modules and the bridge components will be removed.

Long-term steps:

1. Migrate all legacy code to ES6 modules
2. Ensure all code imports the ES6 modules directly
3. Remove global exports from bridge modules
4. Eventually remove bridge modules entirely

## Build Configuration Overview

The build system is split into three webpack configs:

- `webpack.common.js` – shared settings
- `webpack.modern.js` – generates ES module output
- `webpack.legacy.js` – legacy bundle for older scripts

## Recent Fixes

We recently fixed an issue where the Game object was trying to access AI functions before they were available in the global scope:

1. **Problem**: AI functions were referenced directly in the Game constructor
2. **Solution**:
   - Initialized Game.ai array with null values
   - Populated the array in the start_game method
   - Added error handling in com_thinking for graceful fallbacks

This pattern may need to be applied to other components as we continue the modernization process.
