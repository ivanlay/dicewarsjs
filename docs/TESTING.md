# Testing Strategy for Dice Wars JS

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Dice Wars JS project as part of its modernization to ES6 modules.

## Overview

Our testing approach focuses on ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase during the transition from legacy code to modern ES6 modules. We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy using Jest as our testing framework.

## Testing Framework

We use **Jest** as our primary testing framework because it provides:

- A comprehensive test runner with parallel test execution
- Built-in assertion library
- Mocking capabilities for modules and browser APIs
- Coverage reporting
- Watch mode for development

## Directory Structure

Tests are organized to mirror the source code structure:

```
/tests
  /mocks          # Mock files for testing
  /utils          # Tests for utility modules
    gameUtils.test.js
    render.test.js
    sound.test.js
    config.test.js
  /models         # Tests for data models
  /ai             # Tests for AI strategies
  setup.js        # Global test setup
```

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions and modules in isolation. These tests verify that each unit of code behaves as expected.

Examples:

- Testing game utility functions (dice rolling, attack probability)
- Testing rendering functions
- Testing configuration management

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different modules work together correctly. These tests ensure that the bridge between ES6 modules and legacy code functions properly.

Examples:

- Testing that the bridge modules correctly expose ES6 functionality to the global scope
- Testing interactions between game state and rendering

### 3. Functional Tests

Functional tests verify that the application works correctly from a user's perspective. These tests ensure that the game's features work as expected.

Examples:

- Testing game initialization
- Testing game mechanics (attacks, turns)
- Testing AI behavior

## Mocking Strategy

We use various mocking techniques to isolate the code being tested:

1. **Browser APIs**: We mock browser APIs like `localStorage` and CreateJS objects
2. **Module Dependencies**: We mock module dependencies to isolate units of code
3. **DOM Elements**: We use the JSDOM environment provided by Jest

## Code Coverage

We track code coverage to ensure our tests are comprehensive. Our goal is to maintain:

- 80%+ line coverage for utility modules
- 70%+ line coverage for game logic
- Bridge modules are excluded from coverage requirements as they are transitional

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run tests in watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

To run specific tests:

```bash
npm test -- -t "Game Utilities"
```

## Writing Tests

Guidelines for writing tests:

1. **Test Names**: Use descriptive names that indicate what is being tested
2. **AAA Pattern**: Structure tests with Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on other tests
4. **Mocks**: Prefer explicit mocks over global mocks
5. **Assertions**: Use specific assertions that clearly indicate what's being verified

Example of a well-structured test:

```javascript
test('calculates attack probability correctly for advantage scenario', () => {
  // Arrange
  const attackerDice = 5;
  const defenderDice = 2;

  // Act
  const probability = calculateAttackProbability(attackerDice, defenderDice);

  // Assert
  expect(probability).toBeGreaterThan(0.5);
  expect(probability).toBeLessThan(0.95);
});
```

## Continuous Integration

Tests are integrated into our build process:

1. Tests run before building the production version
2. Pull requests require passing tests
3. Test coverage reports are generated and reviewed

## Best Practices

1. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on testing what the code does, not how it's implemented
2. **Small, Focused Tests**: Keep tests small and focused on a single behavior
3. **Maintainable Tests**: Write tests that are easy to understand and maintain
4. **Fast Tests**: Ensure tests run quickly to maintain a good development workflow
5. **Independent Tests**: Make tests independent of each other
6. **Deterministic Tests**: Avoid non-deterministic tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail

## Handling Legacy Code

For legacy code that hasn't been converted to ES6 modules yet:

1. Mock the global objects used by the legacy code
2. Test the Bridge modules to ensure they correctly expose ES6 functionality
3. Use manual testing to verify legacy code functionality until it can be properly tested

## Future Improvements

As we continue the migration to ES6 modules, we plan to:

1. Add more integration tests for game mechanics
2. Implement component testing for UI elements
3. Add performance testing for critical game operations
4. Implement end-to-end testing for complete game scenarios

## Phase 2 Enhancements

The ES6 migration plan outlines several improvements to the testing infrastructure during Phase 2. Details are provided in [PHASE2_TESTING_PLAN.md](./PHASE2_TESTING_PLAN.md). Highlights include:

1. Unit tests covering each bridge module and their fallback logic
2. Integration tests verifying legacy code interaction via the bridges
3. A new regression test suite located in `tests/regression`
4. Updated CI configuration to run unit, integration, and regression tests on every pull request

### Regression Suite

The regression suite resides in `tests/regression`. These tests capture previous bugs or key game scenarios to detect regressions. Run only this suite with:

```bash
npm run test:regression
```

Regression tests are also executed with the standard `npm test` command.

### Bridge Tests

Bridge-related unit and integration tests are located in `tests/bridge`. They ensure ES6 modules are properly exposed to legacy code and that fallback logic works. These tests run automatically with `npm test`.
