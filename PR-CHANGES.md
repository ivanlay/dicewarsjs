# Pull Request: Fix Development Environment Issues

## Issues Fixed

1. **404 errors for bundle files**
   - Fixed `npm run serve` to use webpack-dev-server instead of the serve package
   - Updated webpack configuration for proper chunk naming in development mode
   - Ensured consistent vendor and runtime chunk creation

2. **404 error for game-loader.js**
   - Added game-loader.js from src directory to CopyWebpackPlugin patterns
   - Ensured it's copied to the dist directory for proper loading
   - Fixed MIME type mismatch errors

3. **Sound loading failures**
   - Fixed "Type not recognized" errors for sound files
   - Updated sound loading to use direct paths instead of dynamic imports
   - Added explicit file type indication for CreateJS Sound API
   - Improved sound system initialization with proper plugin configuration

4. **AI function not found warnings**
   - Updated global config.js to include proper AI configuration format
   - Added aiTypes array matching the format expected by the ES6 module system
   - Ensured proper AI loading and configuration during game initialization

5. **AudioContext autoplay warnings**
   - Already properly handled in main.js code
   - Event listener initializes AudioContext on user gesture
   - Made sure code is maintained and properly documented

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Package.json

Updated scripts to use webpack-dev-server consistently:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "webpack serve --mode development",
  "serve": "webpack serve --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production",
  ...
}
```

### 2. Webpack Configuration

Changed runtime chunk configuration for development:

```javascript
config.optimization = {
  runtimeChunk: 'single', // Use 'single' instead of naming it to ensure consistency
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      vendors: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        chunks: 'all',
        enforce: true, // Force creation of this chunk
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Game-Loader.js Copy Configuration

Updated webpack.config.js to copy game-loader.js from the src directory:

```javascript
new CopyWebpackPlugin({
  patterns: [
    // Copy all the legacy JS files
    { from: '*.js', to: '[name][ext]', globOptions: { ignore: ['webpack.config.js'] } },
    // Copy CSS files if any
    { from: '*.css', to: '[name][ext]', noErrorOnMissing: true },
    // Copy sound files for legacy code
    { from: 'sound', to: 'sound' },
    // Copy game-loader.js from src directory
    { from: 'src/game-loader.js', to: 'game-loader.js' },
  ],
}),
```

### 4. Sound System Improvements

Updated sound loading to use direct paths and explicit file types:

```javascript
// Changed from dynamic imports to direct paths
const soundFiles = {
  'snd_button': './sound/button.wav',
  'snd_clear': './sound/clear.wav',
  'snd_click': './sound/click.wav',
  // ...other sounds
};

// Improved sound registration with explicit type
const result = createjs.Sound.registerSound({
  src: soundPath,
  id: soundId,
  type: "wav"  // Explicitly set the file type to avoid MIME detection issues
});
```

### 5. Game Configuration

Updated config.js with proper AI configuration:

```javascript
window.GAME_CONFIG = { 
  // Game rules
  playerCount: 7,
  humanPlayerIndex: 0,    // Set to null for AI vs AI
  averageDicePerArea: 3,
  maxDice: 8,
  
  // AI configuration - string identifiers that match the ES6 module exports
  aiTypes: [
    null,                 // Player 0 (human)
    'ai_example',         // Player 1
    'ai_defensive',       // Player 2  
    'ai_adaptive',        // Player 3
    'ai_default',         // Player 4
    'ai_default',         // Player 5
    'ai_default',         // Player 6
    'ai_default'          // Player 7
  ],
  
  // Spectator mode settings
  spectatorSpeedMultiplier: 2
};
```

### 6. Documentation Updates

Updated CLAUDE.md with the correct project running instructions:

```
## Running the Project

- Run `npm run serve` or `npm run dev` to start the webpack development server
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser to run the game
- A build process is required with `npm run build` for production builds
- AI vs AI testing can be enabled through the configuration system
```

Added proper architecture documentation to clarify the hybrid ES6/legacy structure.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - No more 404 errors for bundle files or game-loader.js
   - Sound files load and play correctly
   - Webpack-dev-server provides hot module replacement
   - Clearer documentation of hybrid architecture

2. **Better Sound System**
   - Eliminated "Type not recognized" errors
   - Reliable sound loading with explicit file type recognition
   - More robust initialization and error handling
   - Proper integration with CreateJS sound API

3. **Better AI Configuration**
   - Eliminated "AI function not found" warnings
   - More maintainable configuration format
   - Proper integration between global config and ES6 modules

4. **Consistent Development Workflow**
   - Development and production builds now handled consistently
   - Proper chunking and code splitting in development
   - Better asset handling for hybrid architecture
   - Documented expected behavior

## Testing Done

Verified the changes work by:
1. Running `npm run serve` and confirming no 404 errors
2. Checking that bundle files are correctly generated
3. Confirming game-loader.js loads correctly
4. Verifying that sound files load and play without "Type not recognized" errors
5. Confirming the game loads and runs properly
6. Validating that AI configuration works as expected

## Notes on Remaining CreateJS Warnings

The CreateJS deprecated property warnings (AbstractLoader.SOUND) are coming from the CreateJS library itself and are not critical. These would require updating the CreateJS library to fix, which is outside the scope of these changes.

The AudioContext autoplay warning is expected behavior in modern browsers, which require user interaction before playing audio. This is handled correctly by the existing code in main.js.
