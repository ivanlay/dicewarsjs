# ES6 Build Optimization & Debugging Tools

## Summary

This PR completes the ES6 build process modernization by implementing:

1. **Modern Asset Loading** - Replaces direct file copying with webpack asset modules, implements lazy loading for sound files, and optimizes loading priority
2. **Detailed Source Maps** - Adds more precise source maps for better debugging in development mode
3. **Advanced Debugging Tools** - Creates a robust debug toolkit with performance monitoring, state inspection, and visual debugging panels
4. **Bundle Analysis** - Adds webpack-bundle-analyzer for identifying optimization opportunities and reducing bundle size

## Changes Made

### Asset Loading Optimization

- Replaced CopyWebpackPlugin approach for sound assets with webpack 5 Asset Modules
- Implemented dynamic imports for sound files with priority-based loading
- Added resource hints (preconnect, preload) for critical assets
- Created a sound loading strategy with critical/gameplay/endgame categorization

### Debugging Infrastructure

- Added comprehensive debug tools for development mode only
- Created debugging panels for visualizing game state
- Added performance measurement for critical game operations
- Implemented FPS monitoring and performance metrics tracking
- Integrated debug tools with the Game class for state inspection

### Bundle Optimization

- Added webpack-bundle-analyzer integration
- Created scripts for analyzing bundle content
- Implemented optimized code splitting strategies
- Added documentation on bundle optimization

### Webpack Enhancements

- Improved source maps configuration for development
- Added NODE_ENV configuration for conditional code
- Implemented better chunk naming for optimized caching
- Added runtime chunk optimization

## Technical Notes

- Debug tools are completely disabled in production builds
- Used conditional dynamic imports for development-only features
- Applied feature detection for advanced browser APIs
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy code through carefully designed bridge modules

## Testing

- Verified asset loading in both development and production builds
- Tested bundle analyzer reports to identify optimization opportunities
- Confirmed debug tools function properly in development mode only
- Verified performance monitoring accurately tracks game metrics

## Documentation

- Added BUNDLE_OPTIMIZATION.md with detailed information on bundle analysis
- Updated NEXT_STEPS.md to reflect completed tasks
- Added JSDoc comments for all new functions and modules
