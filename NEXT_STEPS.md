## Implementation Approach

We will continue with the hybrid approach that has proven successful:
1. Maintain backward compatibility with legacy code via the bridge modules
2. Update one module at a time with comprehensive testing
3. Apply modern ES6+ features incrementally
4. Ensure all changes are well-tested and documented
5. Focus on robustness and error handling to prevent runtime issues

## Recent Issues and Solutions

   - **Solution**:
     - Added comprehensive error handling to all bridge modules (gameUtils, render, sound, ai)
     - Implemented fallback functions to prevent game crashes when modules fail
     - Added module loading with proper import/export structure to match ES6 requirements
